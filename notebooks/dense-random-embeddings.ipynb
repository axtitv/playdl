    "In [word-vectors](word-vectors.ipynb), we created sparse vectors representing words. When added together, these create bag of words (BOW) representations of documents. We can just turn on the particular position of a word in the vector if that word is present in the document. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we are passing words individually to a recurrent neural network (RNN), then these sparse vectors can get pretty big. If there are 20,000 words in the dictionary, we might have vectors of size 20,000. What we need is a dense representation that still gives us unique representations of each word.  (We also used to the hash trick also to try to shrink the size of the sparse vectors, but they are still sparse.)"
