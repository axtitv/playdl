    "# Embed sparse word vectors into high-but-lower-dimensional dense space\n",
    "\n",
    "Word vectors are simple but the vocabulary size can make word vectors extremely long; high dimensionality. And they are very sparse, mostly zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings, on the other hand, embed that massive dimensional space into a smaller, dense space. For example, [GloVE](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) has pre-trained word embeddings of various sizes such as 50 and 300 dimensions. Unlike word vectors, we need to do some training to compute embeddings."
